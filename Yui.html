<p>Yui (ユイ, Yui?) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI), found by Kirito and Asuna around the forests of the 22nd Floor of the floating castle Aincrad. Her official name is «Yui-MHCP001» (Mental Health Counseling Program 001).</p>

<p>Yui had long, dark hair and bright black eyes. Her default equipment consisted of a one-piece white dress with a ribbon tied around her waist. She temporarily wore a long-sleeved pink sweater and a purple skirt, as well as red shoes (brown boots in the anime), during her time with Kirito and Asuna.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2024, while Asuna and Kirito were investigating rumors of a ghost in the forests on the 22nd Floor, Yui wandered close to the couple. When the pair noticed her presence, the young girl silently watched them for several seconds, before collapsing. Out of concern for her well-being, Yui was taken by Asuna and Kirito to their home and settled in their bed, where she remained unconscious for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>At 07:50 the next morning on October 31, Yui began humming to Asuna's wake-up alarm while half-awake. After being fully awakened by the couple, Yui shared her name with them but could not remember anything else. As the little girl experienced difficulty pronouncing their names during breakfast, she was encouraged to simplify their names. As such, Yui hesitantly decided to address them as her parents, becoming overjoyed when the startled duo accepted the roles.</p>

<p>Later, during a quest to find «The Army's» leader, Thinker, in the dungeon of the «Black Iron Palace», Yui touched a stone cube at the center of the safe zone at the deepest part of the dungeon and immediately regained all her memories. She proceeded to defeat The Fatal Scythe using the GM console's «Object Eraser» function that materialized as a giant flaming sword.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Yui, now knowing her purpose as an AI who was going be erased since the system recognized her as an "alien" due to having disobeyed the system's orders, expressed her gratitude to Kirito and Asuna for taking care of her. Just as she disappeared, Kirito used the still active admin access and his computer skills to retrieve and save her as environmental data on his NerveGear and store her core programming as an in-game tear crystal-shaped item named <a href="yuiheart.html">Yui's Heart</a>.</p>
