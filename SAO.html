<h1>Arc 1: Aincrad</h1>
</center>

<p>On November 6, 2022, the first and highly anticipated Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (VRMMORPG) for a special VR console, called the NerveGear, began its official service at 13:00 JST. The game's first 10,000 copies were sold out within moments and about as many players logged in the moment the official service began. However, the enjoyment did not last long as, several hours later, players noticed that the log out button was not working. Soon afterwards, all players were teleported to the Town of Beginnings, where an avatar in red robes descended from the sky and introduced himself as the game's creator, Kayaba Akihiko. Akihiko announced to all players that the only way for them to log out was to beat the game by clearing the boss at the end of each floor of the Floating Castle Aincrad. Akihiko then informed the players that all methods of revival were removed from the game and that if they died in the game, someone from the real world attempted to remove the NerveGear by force, or if the NerveGear was disconnected from a power source or the game's servers for too long, the NerveGear would use microwaves to destroy the player's brain. To prove that he was not joking, Akihiko forced every player's avatar to change to their real life appearance and concluded the tutorial for the game by stating that he had accomplished his desire: to create his own world and control it. This was how the death game known as «Sword Art Online» began.</p>

<p>One of the 1,000 beta testers, named Kirito, began his journey of survival by becoming a solo player and rushing to the nearest village to begin leveling.</p>

<p>Kirito, not wanting to drag others down, takes to being a solo player. After defeating the first floor's boss, he gains a reputation as a "beater" ("beta tester" + "cheater") for being a beta tester who used foreknowledge of the game to his advantage, an epithet he adopts to prevent other beta testers from being scorned. He joins a guild called the "Midnight Black Cats", but after watching them die during an ill-fated attempt to grind on a high-level dungeon, isolates himself from the rest of the playerbase to prevent another such tragedy.</p>

<p>As a solo player, Kirito makes several friends, including Silica, a young but spirited beast-tamer; Lisbeth, a talented if sarcastic blacksmith; and Asuna, a player who helped him against the first floor boss who goes on to be the second-in-command of the game's biggest guild, KoB. In that time, Kirito's skills as a player and swordfigher grows exponentially, eventually leading to him unlocking a hidden "dual wielding" ability that let him fight with two swords at once.</p>

<p>Over time, Kirito and Asuna become closer with one another. After Kirito is forced to join KoB after losing a duel to the guild's leader, Heathcliff, Kirito and Asuna enter into a relationship, marrying one another and moving into a cabin. They eventually meet a young girl named Yui, who at first appears to have no memories and stays with Kirito and Asuna, regarding them as her parents. It is soon revealed that Yui is actually an artificial intelligence created by the game to counsel players suffering from stress, but had been locked away when the game launched until she discovered Kirito and Asuna and reached out to them. Since she had acted outside of her programming limitations, the game's central AI would consider her a glitch and delete her. Kirito manages to save her, however, by converting her data into an in-game item and storing it on his NerveGear's local memory.</p>

<p>Eventually, the players make their way to the 75th floor's dungeon and defeat its boss, but at heavy loss. Kirito comes to a harrowing realization after the raid, however; Heathcliff, the leader of KoB, was actually Akihiko Kayaba, who logged into the game himself in order to weave a narrative of his own design in the game. Heathcliff congratulates Kirito on his discovery by offering him the chance to fight him as the final boss right away; if Kirito won, the game would end and the surviving players would be allowed to log out. Kirito accepts the challenge, but is quickly outclassed. Asuna intercepts a sword blow meant for Kirito, sacrificing her life in the process. Kirito loses the will to fight for a while after, but just as his HP hits zero, his determination renews and he uses Asuna's rapier to land the finishing blow on Heathcliff, defeating him and clearing the game.</p>

<p>Kirito and Asuna, who survived her in-game death, meet in the sky above Aincrad as it collapses due to its data being deleted. Kayaba also appears, explaining that the surviving players had been logged out, but those who died would stay dead. He reveals that he created the game to pursue his dream of finding a castle in the sky before departing.</p>

<p>Once the game ends, Kirito awakens in his hospital room. Weak though his body had become, he uses what strength he has to rise from his sickbed and search for Asuna.</p>
