<p>Asuna Yuuki (明日奈 結城), known as Asuna (アスナ) in «Sword Art Online» (SAO), «ALfheim Online» (ALO), as well as «Project Alicization», where she had temporarily used the Stacia (ステイシア, Suteishia?) account, is the main heroine of the Sword Art Online series, the deuteragonist of the Aincrad Arc, as well as the protagonist of the Mother's Rosario side story. She is the daughter of the former CEO of RECT Inc.. Asuna was one of the 10,000 players trapped in «Sword Art Online», where she was the sub-leader of the «Knights of the Blood» (KoB) guild. Her skills with the rapier had her earned her the nickname «The Flash» (閃光, Senkō?).</p>

<p>By December 2, 2022, Asuna had spent three to four days battling in the 1st Floor's Labyrinth, having taken five Iron Rapiers with her and planning to return as soon as her last one was at half durability. Around 04:00, after dispatching a Ruin Kobold Trooper on the dungeon's nineteenth level with Linear, she leaned against the wall and sank to the floor, when she was approached by a male player, who critiqued her use of Sword Skills on nearly dead enemies as wasted effort. Just as Asuna finished declaring her belief that death was inevitable either way, she collapsed from exhaustion.</p> 

<p>When Asuna awoke seven hours later, she found herself outside the Labyrinth, having been moved to safety by the boy. Before she could leave, she was informed of the First Floor Boss Raid Strategy Meeting taking place in «Tolbana» that afternoon and decided to visit the meeting with the boy. Upon reaching town, the two parted ways briefly.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 22, 2024, Asuna teleported to the main city of the 59th Floor. Seeing Kirito dozing on a hill next to the Teleport Gate plaza, she chided him for not actively assisting the other players in clearing the Labyrinth,[20] but grew surprised when he stated his preference to enjoy the day's pleasant weather settings. Realizing how Kirito viewed his time in Aincrad as simply living in the virtual world, the girl sent the other members of the Knights of the Blood ahead and lay next to the boy, falling into a deep, peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>When Asuna finally awoke over eight hours later, she grew mortified to find Kirito watching her from right beside her; however, she soon realised he had been guarding her from player killers and thus offered the boy a free meal as gratitude for his consideration. At a restaurant in Marten, while waiting for their orders, the two suddenly heard a horrified scream from outside, prompting them to rush to the source. There, they discovered a man impaled with a spear and hanging by his neck from a noose, who seemingly died before anyone could assist him. Convinced that the player had been killed in a duel, the girl and the boy quickly searched for a duel winner notice but found none.</p>

<p>On June 24, 2024, Asuna visited her best friend, Lisbeth, at the latter's shop, and asked for Lisbeth to polish her rapier, the Lambent Light. During this time, Lisbeth deduced that Asuna was in love, and made Asuna promise to bring her new lover to the shop some time later.</p>

<p>Two days later on June 26, after Lisbeth had created a new sword for Kirito and as she was about to confess her feelings to him, Asuna burst into the shop in a panic. She explained that she was worried that something had happened to Lisbeth due to her having gone missing and being unreachable the day before. After Lisbeth explained that she had been stuck in a dungeon and told Asuna that she had been in the dungeon with Kirito, Asuna, who only now noticed Kirito, revealed that Kirito had come to the shop because he had asked her for a place where he could get a strong sword. Lisbeth, who now harbored feelings for the Black Swordsman, realized that he was also the one Asuna loved and took her to a café in Lindarth to confirm whether Kirito was the one Asuna was interested in. After Asuna confirmed this, Lisbeth revealed that Kirito had broken her best sword while testing its durability and that they had gone to a dungeon to find a rare raw material in order to forge a stronger, better sword for him. After talking a bit about the adventure and Kirito, Lisbeth abruptly left under the guise of having an appointment and asked Asuna to keep Kirito company.</p>

<p>After Asuna entered Agil's shop to find Kirito on October 17, 2024, Kirito asked Asuna to cook an ingredient he had found. He revealed that he had acquired a Ragout Rabbit's Meat, an incredibly rare S-class ingredient. Even Asuna, who had recently completed her Cooking skill, had not seen such a rare ingredient before. She demanded to be given half of the rabbit if she cooked it. Kirito reluctantly agreed and the two headed to Asuna's flat in Selmburg, the main city on the 61st Floor. After they ate their fill, Asuna persuaded Kirito to join her party, and the next day on October 18, they discovered the 74th Floor Boss, The Gleam Eyes. They proceeded to hastily retreat to a safe area, where they later encountered Klein and his guild, the «Fuurinkazan», and troops from «The Army».</p>

<p>When «The Army»'s troops left towards the boss room, Asuna, Kirito and the Fuurinkazan followed behind, worried that «The Army»'s troops would get themselves into trouble. They were stalled by a group of lizardmen when they suddenly heard screams. Upon arrival at the door, they discovered with horror that the troops were unable to escape from the wrath of the boss due to the area being an Anti-Crystal Zone. Asuna rushed in to help, only to quickly endanger herself and, consequently, be rescued by Kirito. Together with Klein, she distracted the boss while Kirito prepared his «Dual Blades» skill, then watched with a combination of awe and terror as the two clashed with power she had never seen. In the end, Kirito defeated The Gleam Eyes and, suddenly overcome with fatigue, he collapsed to the ground, noticing that he only had a sliver of his hit points (HP) remaining. Asuna rushed to his side and, upon seeing his state, quickly healed him and then nearly crushed him in an overbearing hug. Shaking with a combination of fear and newfound emotions she had not realized were there until she had seen how her friend had nearly died, Asuna decided to take a break from her guild in order to spend more time with Kirito.</p>

<p>When she returned to «Granzam» to apply for leave, Heathcliff told her that before he could grant her request, he wished to duel with Kirito. He set his terms: if Kirito won the duel, he would allow Asuna to have her requested time off, but if Kirito lost, then Kirito would have to join the Knights of the Blood. The two returned to Granzam so that Kirito could talk with Heathcliff himself, but he ended up accepting the challenge. Kirito was, ultimately, defeated. Godfree, the Commander of the Vanguard of the Knights of the Blood, demanded Kirito's prowess in combat to be tested, despite Kirito having nearly won a duel with Heathcliff. Before leaving on the test, Kirito confided in Asuna his dark past with the Moonlit Black Cats guild. She embraced him as he tensed up and whispered in his ear that she was not planning on dying anytime soon, so he needed to stop worrying about her.</p>

<p>After Kirito departed with Godfree and Kuradeel, Asuna anxiously watched the party's progress on her own map back at the KoB headquarters, not being allowed to join them. Midway into their trip, Asuna noticed Godfree's disappearance from the map and rushed to save Kirito with panicked, adrenaline-fueled speed that players were, supposedly, incapable of reaching. She narrowly saved Kirito from Kuradeel, who had betrayed them midway through the trip, but was unable to bring herself to kill the man, despite all of her anger towards him for nearly killing someone she cared a great deal about. In that moment, Kuradeel sensed his opportunity and struck, launching a surprise attack against her. Despite Kuradeel's advantage, Kirito was fast enough to deflect the blow, albeit costing him his own hand, and he then finished Kuradeel off.</p>

Despite Kuradeel's advantage, Kirito was fast enough to deflect the blow, albeit costing him his own hand, and he then finished Kuradeel off.</p>

<p>Upon realizing how her indecision had nearly killed both of them, Asuna collapsed to the ground in tears. She believed that her presence near Kirito had put him in danger, and through her tears told him that she wanted to stay away from Kirito, lest her presence once again be a liability upon him. Kirito, realizing that he was on the verge of losing her, chose to surprise Asuna by kissing her passionately. Asuna, while shocked, did not turn him away and instead melted into the kiss. Kirito solemnly declared his emotions for her, how he had come to realize that Asuna meant the world and more to him and that he would do anything to stay by her side. Asuna said the same to him, and Kirito requested that he be allowed to sleep with Asuna that night.</p>

<p>Later that night, after finishing their dinner together in Asuna's place, Asuna nervously turned down the lights and slowly removed her clothing. Kirito was completely and utterly shocked and quickly explained that he simply meant he wanted to stay by her side that night and not what Asuna was implying. Embarrassed by the situation, Asuna shouted and attacked Kirito, though the «Area» effect stopped her. Once things had been cleared up, they finally did sleep together and, later that night, Kirito proposed to Asuna, which she happily accepted.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2024, while walking through the woods and while Kirito was playfully scaring Asuna with ghost stories, they saw a pale entity in the forest. Convinced that Kirito's stories were true, Asuna screamed and hid behind him, but Kirito realized that the entity was actually a young girl. They walked up to her and tried to talk to her, but she suddenly fell unconscious. They carried her back to their cabin where they waited for her to wake up. Upon waking up, the girl had no memories, save for her own name: Yui. They then decided to help Yui find her real family, as Yui seemed far too young to be alone in SAO. They took her to the «Town of Beginnings» on the 1st Floor where they took her to a church where many other young children trapped in SAO had taken residence, but the person taking care of the children there, Sasha, confirmed that she had never seen Yui. Yulier, the sub-leader of «The Army», suddenly showed up at the church and besought Kirito and Asuna for their help in finding her husband, Thinker, the leader of «The Army», who had disappeared several days prior in a Hidden Dungeon beneath the Black Iron Palace. Yui stubbornly insisted on accompanying them.</p>

<p>After descending into the dungeon, they eventually found Thinker in a safe zone. Yulier rushed forward, overjoyed at the sight of her lover safe, but was barely saved from being ambushed by a boss: The Fatal Scythe. Kirito quickly ordered Asuna to take Yui and teleport to safety while he distracted the boss, but Asuna defied him and instead pushed Yui into Yulier's arms and told them to take her out of there with them. Asuna and Kirito managed to deflect a single blow from the boss but were completely overwhelmed by the effort, as the boss nearly killed them with its first strike. They realized that its level must match that of the 90th Floor and above bosses and that it would easily kill them if they resist any further. However, while they were struggling to get up, Yui intervened, materializing a massive, flaming, two-handed greatsword, the Object Eraser. Yui deleted the boss from the game, and Kirito and Asuna followed her into the safe-zone that Yulier and Thinker had teleported from.</p>

<p>here, they found an admin console, which, with admin credentials, could be used to control various aspects of the game. Yui revealed that she had recovered her memory and explained that she was actually an AI mental health counseling program that was sealed away on the first day of SAO's launch. After noticing a couple with unusual emotions, such as happiness, she developed a desire to be near Asuna and Kirito. However, Yui had been slated for deletion by the Cardinal System, the program which oversaw SAO's processes, after it deemed her as a foreign body due to ignoring its orders. Powerless to do anything, Asuna clung desperately to her "daughter", but Yui was deleted in Asuna's arms. Asuna collapsed to the floor, overwhelmed with sorrow, and lamented Yui's death, but Kirito intervened. Using Yui's still active admin credentials, he accessed the admin console and transferred Yui's data to his own NerveGear's local memory and transformed her into a game object, called Yui's Heart, in the form of a tear-shaped necklace for Asuna to wear and remember her by.</p>

<p>Two weeks later on November 7, 2024, they were called back by Heathcliff who explained that the next floor boss had been found, but was stronger than anticipated, as it had killed half of the members in the scouting party, while the other half were locked out of the boss room. Fearing for Asuna's safety, Kirito asked her to stay behind in the guild hall where it was safe. However, she refused and stated that she would kill herself if she found out that Kirito was killed in action, being unable to forgive herself for not going. After a short conversation about what their real life bodies must be going through, Asuna began to cry as Kirito embraced her in his arms. She told Kirito that she wished to be with him forever, to date in real life, and to truly get married. </p>

<p>Later on, they joined the guilds in attacking the 75th Floor Labyrinth's boss where, after defeating the boss, Kirito deduced and exposed Heathcliff's true identity as Kayaba Akihiko, the creator of SAO. Before challenging Kirito to a final duel, he put the other players in a state of paralysis. However, as Kirito was about to be struck down by Heathcliff, Asuna managed to move herself in front of the fatal blow, causing her character to die. Stricken with pain, Kirito continued fighting on, despite his HP reaching 0, and he managed to deal a fatal blow to Heathcliff with Asuna's rapier. After the battle, when Aincrad began to break down, Asuna and Kirito met once again in a special area created by Akihiko, who prevented them from dying because he wanted to talk to them, and told each other their real names. Afterwards they decided to kiss and fade away from the world as one.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<p>Asuna originally did not care about dying in the game before meeting Kirito. That meeting drastically changed Asuna's personality and outlook on life. She soon takes most things Kirito says to heart and looks to him for help, using him as somewhat of a lifeline.</p> 
<p>Asuna is a kind and helpful young woman who, similarly to Kirito, cannot abandon another in trouble. She takes the game very seriously and is determined to clear it before Kirito tells her to enjoy SAO a bit. Asuna is also somewhat proud and despite her kind personality, she will not hesitate to get physical with those that challenge her authority or make fun of her abilities, such as cooking. She even challenged Kirito to a duel after an argument over how to handle a Field Boss. She is not afraid to act out on her own and will take matters into her own hands from time to time.</p> 
<p>Asuna, in a similar manner to Kirito, is someone who can be controlled and manipulated by her emotions. This is evident during Kirito's final duel with Heathcliff on the 75th Floor, when she resisted her paralysis, jumped in front of Kirito, and took an attack that would have otherwise killed him. She also cannot handle seeing others die in front of her, such as when she recklessly attacked The Gleam Eyes after seeing the Aincrad Liberation Force players getting slaughtered.</p> 
<p>In ALO, after being saved by Kirito, Asuna's personality had not changed a bit except that she was not as proud as she was in SAO. Her personality began to develop further still after meeting Yuuki in the events of Mother's Rosario. Seeing how Yuuki still moves forward, despite knowing her death is inevitable, Asuna takes after her and resolves to keep moving forward, no matter what happens.</p> 

<h2>Background</h2> 

<p>Asuna lived a comfortable life in her large home in Setagaya with her mother, father, and her brother. She originally went to private, all-girl schools before the events of SAO.</p>

<p>On November 6, 2022, Asuna logged onto SAO after she borrowed her brother's NerveGear. He was one of the people who waited in line for the game's release, but due to a sudden business trip, could not play on the opening day. When she discovered that she and all of the players were trapped in SAO, she secluded herself inside of her rented room in the «Town of Beginnings» for two weeks before resolving to take her fate into her own hands. This led her to kill monsters at an incredible rate and level up in a quick fashion, even risking her life in the process.</p>
